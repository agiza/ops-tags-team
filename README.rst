Ops Tags Team
=============

The Ops Tags Team exists to define tags for ops, allowing users to make better
decisions by providing useful information about OpenStack software projects.

Further information can be found at:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Operations/Tags

The team conducts its initial development of tags
in a this repository using the OpenStack gerrit workflow
( http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html )
while the discussions around where they will eventually end up (both
file-wise and display-wise) are conducted.
